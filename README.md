# CSB340_PageReplacement report
in ever category optimal performed the best of course but I think that in terms of configuration it also naturally followed that larger page frames would encounter less page faults. As for differences between LRU and FIFO, 100,000 runs through the 27 generated variations gave 7.784 page faults per attempt , while fifo and lru had 8.978 and 8.979 respectively. This makes me believe that the functional difference between them is negligible. for time complexity both fifo and lru were o(n) for me, while opt was o(n^2). I think I couldve done it more efficiently but I was having some issues so decided to do it a more straightforward way.
